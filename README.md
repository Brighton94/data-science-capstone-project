# data-science-capstone-project
In this project, I analyzed different kinds of venues using the power of k-means clustering to seek the hidden patterns about the most visited venues in each of the suburbs within the City of Johannesburg municipality. I find it convenient to view the notebook via _nbviewer_ at https://nbviewer.org/github/Brighton94/data-science-capstone-project/blob/master/johannesburg-venues-ml.ipynb
## 1.1 Business Problem
Suppose that there is a contractor trying to open a restaurant within the Johannesburg municipality, how can we use the current machine learning techniques to determine the suitable locations?
To begin answering the question, it is reasonable to ask what makes a good location to situate a restaurant at? These are some of the key features to consider when opening a new restaurant:

__Visibility:__ Urban areas tend to have high car and foot traffic. Locating a restaurant around towns would hence be a good choice. However, it could be possible to find places that offer high visibility for the restaurant, but also have high crime rates. Such areas are not best suited for family-style restaurant.

__Parking:__ Places near parking lots would be another good choice. It would be ideal to have a restaurant with it’s own parking lot.

__Accessibility:__ It could be beneficial to have a restaurant built across a road with a relatively low speed limit and high car traffic. Supposedly around freeway/highway exits. As for foot traffic, a location near urbanized areas would be ideal. Inside shopping malls, an ideal place to have a restaurant would be within or near food courts.
There are many other factors to also consider such as average income and the population of the area of interest. However, the goal of this project is to find out how urbanized an area is by finding out the most popular venues within that area (by 500 meters to be exact)and seek out hidden patterns that may reveal some additional information about a location.
## 1.2 The Data Set
For this project, the geolocation data that I used was from Carto.com [here](https://adi45.carto.com/tables/metropolitan_suburbs_region/public/map).

I wrote [a blog post on medium](https://brightonnkomo.medium.com/analyzing-venues-in-johannesburg-suburbs-with-machine-learning-ffc9b50dfb6b) to present my findings and insights. I basically describe what the problem is, the EDA that I did, why I used particluar machine learnings and the results.
